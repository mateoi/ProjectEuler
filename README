These are my solutions for some Project Euler problems.

Project Euler (projecteuler.net) is a website that posts mathematical
problems for its useres to solve. Ususally they are too hard to solve by hand,
so you have to code a script to do it for you.

As you go through the problems, coding starts to become insufficient and
analysis of the problem is needed.

I've done most problems up to P100, but there are hundreds more. If a problem
isn't in here, it probably means I haven't solved it yet. I'm open to
collaborating if anyone is interested.
